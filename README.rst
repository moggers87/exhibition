Exhibition - A Python Static Site Generator
===========================================

.. inclusion-marker-do-not-remove-start

Say it right:

    /ɛgs'hɪb'ɪʃ(ə)n/

So something like:

    eggs hib ish'n

What?
-----

A static site generator

Where?
------

- Download: https://pypi.org/project/exhibition/
- Source: https://codeberg.org/moggers87/exhibition
- Docs: https://exhibition-ssg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

License?
--------

GPLv3 or later. See LICENSE for the actual text.

Why though?
-----------

I'd been using `Hyde`_ for a number of years, eventually that project stopped
receiving updates. Hyde had very limited test coverage, many features that I
didn't personally use, and no Python 3 support.  This combination made the
prospect of maintaining Hyde daunting, so forking was out of the question.

.. _`Hyde`: https://github.com/hyde/hyde

In the end, I wrote Exhibition as other available static site generators would
either require massively rewriting the sites I already had or weren't flexible
enough to generate the same URL structure.

What's the status of this project?
----------------------------------

There are tests, there's some documentation, and I currently use it for a
number of websites, including my personal blog.

Contributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I'm always looking for contributions, whether they be bug reports, bug fixes,
feature requests, new features, or documentation. Also, feel free to open issues
for support requests too - these are very helpful in showing me where
documentation is required or needs improving.
